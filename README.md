# Deterministic Linear Programming

## Development
This work was the group assignment I and my partner did in the Fall Semester 2021 for OPM 682 Revenue Management course taught by [Prof. Dr. Cornelia Schön](https://www.bwl.uni-mannheim.de/schoen/ "Prof. Dr. Cornelia Schön"), University of Mannheim.

## Description of Problem
We, assuming the role of management team at a hotel on a small island in the North Sea, are tasked to determine the optimal number of guests to accept for our 5 different room package such that the revenue of the hotel is maximized.

The table below summarizes our products and the corresponding prices and expected demands.

|No.|Package|Price|Expected Demand|
|---|---|---|---|
|1|3-night stay (day 1 to 4)|900|60|
|2|2-night stay (day 1 to 3)|300|60|
